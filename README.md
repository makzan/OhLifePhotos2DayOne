OhLifePhotos2DayOne
===================

Import OhLife exported photos into DayOne

## Usage:
1. Copy the `OhLifePhotos2DayOne.rb` script file to the OhLife exported folder.
2. Open terminal, execute: `cd <Path of the OhLife exported folder>` (Note, you can drag the folder to terminal instead of typing the path yourself)
3. Execute the command `ls -m img_*` and you should see a list of photo files. This is to ensure we have everything prepared.
4. Execute the command `ls -m img_* | ruby OhLifePhotos2DayOne.rb`.
